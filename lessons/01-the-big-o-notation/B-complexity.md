# Algorithmic Complexity

Algorithmic Complexity is of two type.

- Time Complexity - measure of how much time it takes to run the algorithm
- SPace Complexity - measure of how much space it takes to run the algorithm

There are three notations to measure algorithmic complexity.

- BIG-O
- BIG-Ω
- BIG-θ
