# What is an Algorithm?

All the softwares or programs we write heavily relay on data. And we don't want this data to scatter all across the memory. We want it neatly placed in the memory, so when ever need it we can easily access it from there.

How do we achieve this neat representation of data in the memory. We use data structures for that. Data Structures are in the memory representation of the data.

- How we are going to represent the data in memory
- And how we are going to access it from there when ever we need it

Different kinds of Data Structures

- Arrays
- Linked List
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees
- Graphs
